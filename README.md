# Microcavity-Interefermete-Control
This project is designed to control the position of an optical fiber over an atomic force microcantilever for N amount of steps and monitors and saves the resultant interference plots of the DC components of 1550nm and 1310nm light. It names the resultant file the current date and time, then makes a copy of a template python file with the same name, for which the template file is self referencing so that GUI viewing of acquired data post acquisition is as easy as running the relavant .py file of the same name.
