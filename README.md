# Optical Cavity Control and Automatic Interferometry Analysis
This project uses an Analog Discovery 2 (digital oscilloscope and arbitrary waveform generator) to deliver sawtooth waveforms to piezo motors that control the size of an optical cavity, and monitors four DC signals that change as a function of cavity size. The program utilizes a template file called 'do_not_rename.py' within the same directory as 'fiber_walker.py' to later visualize and automatically process the acquired data in a subsequently generated data folder.
