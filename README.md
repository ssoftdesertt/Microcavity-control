# Optical Cavity Control and Automatic Interferometry Analysis
This Python program uses an Analog Discovery 2 (digital oscilloscope and arbitrary waveform generator) to deliver sawtooth waveforms to piezo motors that control the size of an optical cavity in a Michelson interferometer formed by a silicon micro cantilever and an optical fiber., It also monitors four DC signals that change as a function of the interferometer cavity size (Amplitude, Phase, 1550nm DC, and 1310nm DC). The program utilizes a template file called 'do_not_rename.py' within the same directory as 'fiber_walker.py' to later visualize and automatically process the acquired data in a subsequently generated folder named the current date and time. 'do_not_rename.py' serves as the data analyzer, and uses the main interferometer detection signal to detect local peaks over the entire span of its data set, the program then uses the distance between each peak and assumes that for one period the cavity has changed in size by a quarter wavelength (in this case 387nm). The program then uses a polynomial fit to fit the detection signal, then take the absolute value of the derivative of the polynomial fit and scales it with relative gain values used in the circuit responsible for the acquisition and against the peak detection distance value to generate a plot of the cantelever's deflection in [nm/V] for s sweep of cavity size. It then super-imposes values from the polynomial-fit onto this data set for a visual tool in precision cavity size control for later experiments in noise analysis.
